KOMBAT TEAMS v2.07 updates

* if a match is a 2 teams match with more than 2 people involved from the start, KT now tells you who
  is leading by how much @ the minute report.
* changed the functionality of /scores
* avoid * 2 turneded into "KT SpawnSafety" (see technical notes)
* new command: /pickup (see kombat.txt)
* doubled the number of gameticks (now 120) of respawn-frag safety after you're
  newly spawned in Kombat Teams spawnmode
* /forcestart can now start matches with only one player (fun? :)) again
* added separators after the listings of /who /whonot /whoskin

* optimized/changed some code for match-start
* teams printout on /ready
* players that changes teams during game only gets kicked now (aren't rewarded -2 frags anymore)
* enhanced spawnfrags avoidance on mapentry (not just normal qw spawns)
* fixed the look of the timer on /scores (when only seconds remain)
* added an alias: /notready (/break)
* /reset now performs an "exec configs/reset.cfg" on the server instead of using the old KT defaults
* /reset if you are an admin tries to "exec configs/<yourteam>.cfg" on the server. if you currently are in
  team "" (teamless) then it will "exec configs/reset.cfg" instead. this is useful for leagues where different
  teams uses different settings etc.
* performs amount of players check after countdown/before match now (not only min/max teams)
* mapguard now never changes map if mastermode or lockmap is set
