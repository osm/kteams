KOMBAT TEAMS SOURCECODE is a modified version of the qw2.10 source by
kemiKal_sWeMoB and Fang with some M4 macro code by Axu^FAQ^.
It is only meant to be functional and not to revolutionize the world of
programming and is a bit messy at best.
The FASTQCC compiler is the only one guaranteed to work with this code.
You can find it on ftp.cdrom.com/pub/idgames2/ somewhere..
If you're thinking of editing this patch, read the "kombat.txt" that
should be enclosed in the package...


thanks,
