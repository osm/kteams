KOMBAT TEAMS v2.07
------------------

Kombat Teams is a QUAKEWORLD ONLY patch by kemiKal_sWeMoB and Fang and means
to simplify all forms of deathmatch games (1-1, 2-2, 4-4, 3-3-3, 31-1 etc.).

It's a public release and provided with absolutely no warranties.
The authors take no responsibility for the behaviour and functionality of it.

INSTALLATION
------------

Create a directory called "kteam" in your quakedirectory and copy all files supplied
with the patch into it. Edit the "server.cfg" file to your liking and start the server
by typing "qwsv +gamedir kteam". Please refer to the quakeworld server documentation
if you want your server to show up on any of the masterservers available.
For best server performance, run your server on a machine using unix (or any of its clones)
or a PC running WINDOWS NT. Please make sure that you use the QuakeWorld 2.3 server to
run the patch.


PLAYER COMMANDS EXPLAINED
-------------------------
* "about":
     Shows you the versionnumber of the patch and a small note.

* "ready":
     Tell the server that you're ready for some action.

* "break":  ("notready")
     PREGAME:   tells the server that you're not ready after all.
     COUNTDOWN: stops the countdown (maybe to change some settings).
     MATCH:     toggle your vote for match-break (if you've got a majority voting with
                you, the match will stop and results won't be logged).

* "dm":
     Steps through deathmatch-modes 1-5.

* "tp":
     Steps through teamplay-modes 0-3.

* "powerups":
     Toggles the availability of powerups during game (quad/666/ring/env.suit).
     Pre game, quad and 666 will glow if powerups are enabled and not if not :)

* "discharge":
     Toggles if players should be allowed to "discharge" in water.
     If disabled, players will only loose all their cells on discharge but not
     actually harm anyone.

* "spawn":
     Toggles between
      0. qw respawns (avoid spawnfrags)
      1. kt spawnsafety

* "spawn666":
     Toggles player invulnerability on respawn during match.
     The invulnerability (666) will last for 2 secs but the player will not glow
     to give away spawnposition.
     Should the player attack with any weapon but axe or shotgun during these 2
     seconds, his/her 666 will vanish.

* "berzerk":
     Toggles berzerk mode.
     Berzerk mode is meant to release agression built up after a cautious game.
     When only "k_btime" seconds remains of the game, all players gets QUAD/OCTA powered
     for the remainder of the match and the whole level starts strobing.
     The first 2 seconds, everyone enjoys a bit of satan's power.
     (The 2 seconds of 666 was put in to prevent disastrous berzerk rocketjumps)

     Also outs remaining matchtime.
     It will only show scores in matches that involves 2 teams (no more, no less)
     and atleast 3 players on match-start.

* "k_soundX":
     Where X is a value between 1 and 6.
     Plays a soundfile on all your teammates computers (if they've got k_sound
     set to 1). If you want your client to play sounds that your teammates triggers,
     type (in the console):
            setinfo k_sound 1
     Your teammates must have the files "ktsound1.wav" - "ktsound6.wav" in their
     "id1/sound" directory or they won't hear anything regardless of the k_sound
     flag.
     Remember: If you trigger ktsound1.wav, it will play the ktsound1.wav that
               resides on your teammates disk/s, not the one on yours.
     *** The default samples are:
         ktsound1.wav "Home"
         ktsound2.wav "Cellar"
         ktsound3.wav "Tower"
         ktsound4.wav "Help/Assist"
         ktsound5.wav "Warning"
         ktsound6.wav "Report"
 
     The standard soundbanks can be found at http://www.kemikal.com.
     To be able to use your samples on any server running KT1.96 or higher -
     put the samples in your "ID1/sound" directory (if "sound" doesn't exist,
     create it yourself).
     Alternatively you can create subdirectories inside ID1/sound called
     "male", "female" etc. and put the desired soundbanks into these - then
     during game you can tell Kombat Teams that you want a female voice by
     typing (in the console):
            setinfo k_sdir "female"

* ("admin"):
     If admins are allowed on the server, this is how you become one.
     A six digit code will then be asked of you.
     Each digit is entered by an impulse command between 1 and 9.


SPECTATOR COMMANDS EXPLAINED
----------------------------
* "status":
     Prints match-settings.

* "status2":
     Even more match-settings printouts.

* "who":

* "whoskin":
     Prints all players skins.

* "scores":
     Prints teamscores during game. Adds frags for dropped players (ie GHOSTS).

     Each digit is entered by an impulse command between 1 and 9.


ADMIN COMMANDS EXPLAINED
------------------------
* "admin":
     Relieve you of your admin rights.

* "master":
     Toggles mastermode.
     In mastermode, only admins may change matchsettings (dm/tp/powerups etc).
     Mastermode also functions as a maplock.

* "forcestart":
     Gives players 10 seconds to ready themselves, after which they get kicked if
     they're still not ready.
     Readied admins may type break to interrupt the countdown.
     Countdown then commences as usual.

* "forcebreak":
     Forces match to end.
     Results will be logged as usual but "%forcebreak%<adminname>" will tell
     statistics-programs that the match was ended unnaturally and by whom.

* "forcepause":
     Toggles pause during match.

* "lockmap":
     Toggles maplock.
     If maplock is enabled, only admins may change map.

     Toggles the "k_prewar" flag.
     When k_prewar = 1:  players can fire prior to match
                         (actually they can fire during too :))
     When k_prewar = 0:  players can't fire prior to match
                         (this is the discipline setting)


NOTE: spectator admins can also use the following commands:
      /tp /dm /powerups /timeup /timedown /spawn /silence /qtimer /qlag /qenemy /reset /maps

QIZMO COMMANDS EXPLAINED
------------------------
* "qtimer":
     fpd XOR 2.
     Toggles lockout of the Qizmo powerup timers.

* "qlag":
     fpd XOR 8.
     Toggles lockout of the Qizmo lag-set features.

* "qenemy":
     fpd XOR 32.
     Toggles lockout of the Qizmo enemies in the vicinity reporting.

! Note that the Qizmo commands uses a serverinfo key called "fpd" that is common to almost all
  other proxies as well: Cheapo, ProxyLite etc..
  The command is named after the Qizmo because the "fpd" key was introduced by its authors.

!! for more information on Qizmo, Cheapo, ProxyLite and NF proxy, look elsewere on the web.



SERVER.CFG EXPLAINED

KOMBAT TEAMS technical notes
----------------------------

*** KOMBAT TEAMS IN DUEL MODE :

If k_duel is set to 1, the server will not allow teamplay changes.
Meaning, if you're running a 1-1 server - set k_duel to 1 and teamplay to 0.
Also, /forcestart or the idle bot forcestart usually requiers you to join an
existing team while counting down, this is not the case in duel mode.


*** THE OPTIONAL MODIFIED DEATHMATCH 2 MODE :

Setting the flag "k_dm2mod" in the server.cfg to 1 removes all armor on the map at
matchstart if deathmatch mode 2 is chosen. The normal dmm2 is available by setting
the same serverflag to "0".


*** WHAT'S THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE RESPAWN-TYPES? :

Kombat Teams respawns differs from the normal QW respawns (also available in the
patch) in that they spawn players on a spawnpoint even though someone else is occupying
it. There's exceptions to this rule however, a player that has just spawned is
considered a no spawn-target for 120 gameticks and a player can never spawn on the same
spot twice in a row (unless the map contains less than 2 spawnpoints or all spawnpoints
are full).
For the first 3 seconds of a match, Kombat Teams respawns will attempt to avoid spawnfrags
entirely (note that this is only for the spawntype "Kombat Teams respawns").
To have yourself spawned at what you consider to be a bad spawn before the match starts
as not to get there won't work, the patch doesn't take pregame spawns into account.
This type of respawns is by default enabled in KT since the patch's main function is to
handle teamgames and we don't want any camping on important spots (like RA on dm4 for
example).
With the release of version 2.07, "KT SpawnSafety" was introduced.
KT SpawnSafety means to avoid telefrags during games as much as possible (even if all
spawnpoints are full) and tries to avoid spawning you at the same spot twice in a row.


*** WHAT'S UP WITH THE LEVEL EXITS? :

KT removes all "level-exits" at the start of each match. You will be able to walk through
those teleporters without anything happening. Pre-game, you can still change level by
walking through them (if the server's "samelevel" is set accordingly).


*** WHAT "report" REALLY REPORTS:

Best illustrated by example output, here's a couple:

(player): a:0  h:100  sg:25       (no armor, 100 health and a shotgun with 25 shells)
(player): ga:30  h:30  rl:5       (30 worth of green armor, 30 health and rocket launcher
                                  with 5 rockets)
(player): ra:200  h:250  rl:100  [-quad-]
                                  (200 units of red armor, 250 health, a rocket launcher
                                  with 100 rockets and the player is quadpowered)

ARMOR TYPES: green (GA) yellow (YA) and red (RA)
WEAPONS: (this is the importancy order from lowest to highest)
         axe (AXE) shotgun (SG) nailgun (NG) super shotgun (SSG) super nailgun (SNG)
         grenade launcher (GL) lightning gun (LG) rocker launcher (RL)


*** WHAT'S WITH ALL THOSE "his glasses" AND "his death" TEXTS? :

Quake (and QW) uses male orientated messages that may or may not annoy you depending
on your gender. Since the legend tells that there are a few girls and women out there
gibbing with the rest of us, KT's got a function that displays genderbased messages
accordingly. Your gender is determined as MALE by default but can be set to
female by typing (in the console):
                      setinfo gender f
(alternatively, you can put that line in your autoexec.cfg).
Anything other than an "f" is considered a MALE..


*** ABOUT TEAM-TELEFRAGS:

If you get telefragged by one of your teammates, s/he doesn't get any frags for it
but you get a death registred (not a -1 on frags but a +1 on deaths).


*** LOCKTYPES:

OFF  = no locking.
ALL  = lockout all players trying to enter if game is in progress.
TEAM = lockout all players trying to enter during match if their team is not set to
       one of the teams playing.

Serversettings that functions as locks of a sort, are:
k_lockmin (minimum number of teams in game)
k_lockmax (maximum number of teams in game)
k_membercount (minimum number of players in each team)
k_exclusive (if set, maxplayers is locked on matchstart)


*** SERVER RESET:

On /reset, KT will execute the file "configs/reset.cfg" on the server.
The ZIPped package of Kombat Teams should contain this directory and file.
That file is to be considered as the server "defaults" and can be freely
reconfigured as the server admin see fits.
If the server allow admins, admins may also execute special admin configs on
the server, where the server keeps settings for different leagues, gametypes etc.
This is done like this:
     1. become an admin by /admin and the correct sequence of impulses
     2. change /team to the name of the config you want to execute on the server
        (for example /team 1vs1, /team lock, /team dql etc.).
     3. now type /reset
     4. if the server finds your config (configs/<yourteam>.cfg) the server will
        exectue it and out a message to the player(s) that the server is setup according to
        your desires. if you are in team "", KT will simply execute "configs/reset.cfg" instead.

A sample admin server setup can be found in configs as "kk.cfg".


*** ALIEN MAPS:

Since KT support maps that some people might not have on their hd it also allows the serveradmin
to set a defaultmap to which it will change to when the last player on the server logs out.
In older versions of KT players could log off during mapchange which could leave the server empty
on an unwanted map; KT now checks a minute after mapchange if the server is empty or not - if it
is, KT switches back to k_defmap.
Alternatively ofcourse, the admin (you) can allow map downloading.
The localinfo value to set defaultmap is called "k_defmap". If "k_defmap" is not set - KT won't
try to change to the default map.


*** THE IDLE BOT:

This is a mean fellow.
If activated (by setting k_idletime above 0) he will wait for at least 50% of the players on the
server to go ready, after that he will nag on the others to go ready every 5 seconds thereafter
(and seconds 4, 3, 2 and 1).
After "k_idletime" seconds have passed (since 50% of the players got ready) the idlebot will
kick all players that have failed to go ready and start normal countdown if more than 2 players
remain on the server.
It is only recommended that you use the idlebot for public servers that are 1vs1 or 2vs2 oriented.
Don't annoy your guests :)


*** /PICKUP:

A simple function. If a majority (> 50%) of the players vote for "pickup", KT will set all
the players skins to "base", their color to 0 (white) and their team to "" (nothing).
