These configs are examples. Edit them to suit your needs. Make sure you
understand every option you change.

In case you already have customized configs and don't want to overwrite then
re-customize them, the changes to KTeam 2.20 configs are:

* removed sv_maxtic line that caused slow rockets/grenades on win32 servers
* upped maxrate to 18000
* added k_noframechecks key to toggle timedemo/uptime bug checks on the server

sv_mintic 0.013 should be still present in all server configs.
