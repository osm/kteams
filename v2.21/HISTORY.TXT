KOMBAT TEAMS v2.21 updates
--------------------------
Fixes:

* The Sudden Death bug where match would often end after some time without any
  players dying is now gone.
* Disconnected then rejoined players now get their frags back properly again.
* Removed "-d" Stuffing for players joining due to source being released
  Kleenex use unlikely.

Additions:

* "official" command sets most common teamplay settings to ease the starting of
  a league game and prevent problems discovered in mid-game. Options changed:
     Fraglimit set to 0
     Timelimit set to 20
     Teamplay set to 2
     Deathmatch set to 1
     Dropquad off
     Dropring off
     KT SpawnSafety
     Discharges on
     Berzerk mode off
     Overtime set to time based
     Overtime length set to 5 minutes
* Setting "k_noframechecks" to 1 in server config will disable the check for
  timedemo and uptime bugs. If you run a public server you should indeed have
  it enabled, the ability to disable it is intended for testing purposes only.
  Users can see if the check is disabled on the server with the "status2"
  command.
* Spectators now have the "elect" command as well, to request admin rights.

KOMBAT TEAMS v2.20 updates
--------------------------
Fixes:

* Teleporter sound is now instant, not delayed 0.2 seconds.
* You only lose 5 hp when falling with high velocity, never 10. (was a bug)
* Ammopickups now obey b_switch (never change to better weapon)
* Fixed that annoying bug when the player dies standing and cannot respawn on
  the level. (No kill and stuff helped, just reconnect.)
* Totally empty packs do have active weapon (or last fired one with fairpacks 2)

Changes/additions:

* Changed a lot of texts and printout colors, hope for good :)
* Scores now reports seconds in the last minute of a match
* Added some new deathmessages. For stat freaks, "deathmsg" command toggles if
  new messages should be used (together with old ones of course)
* fun message commands. You can set 2 strings via setinfo: premsg and postmsg.
  Example: setinfo premsg "Hello "
           setinfo postmsg "!"
  Then issuing the commands killer, victim or newcomer will put the name
  of the corresponding player between these 2 strings and say it.
* Admin rights are gone at levelchange. If you know the admincode, this
  shouldn't be a heavy class problem for you to overcome. If you were elected,
  you shouldn't play god forever.
* Changed "forcekick" to kick + have it done on a y/n basis
* Added "Sudden death" overtime mode. If the time is over and results are tied,
  game won't end while frags are equal (that is, until one player dies).
* You can't bunny immediately after you have been injured from falling. (can
  jump in the next frame though). Not even the best players can play rabbit
  with a broken ankle.
* Altered setting printouts at countdown start. Spawnmodel is printed every
  time, but other options are only listed if they differ from the default.
* Forcestart centerprints the "get ready" warnings only for not ready players.
* Introduced Team Picker mode. See description at new commands.
* Included check for uptime bug. Win95/98 QW2.30 clients mistime their frames
  and send more packets if the comp is up for more than one day (approx), which
  results in faster player movement. If you ignore the warnings to reboot or
  upgrade, you'll be kicked. (code by Zibbo)
* Refashioned endmatch score table, now works for multiple teams plus tied high
  scores for current map are handled :)
* Setting "k_autoreset" to 1 in server.cfg will force the mod to execute
  configs/reset.cfg when last player disconnects. Useful if you don't want to
  have your server in an unknown state, and auto-set tp, dm, etc.
* Any player dying of squish is gibbed. Amount of damage is not altered, just
  the effect :)

New commands:

* The "elect" command announces admin election with k_allowvoteadmin checked.
  Voting by yes/no, majority vote makes you admin.
* "freeze" command toggles if lifts and platforms should work before matchstart.
  At countdown start map is frozen so that no doors are open at beginning.
* Random Team Picker: "rpickup" by an admin will sort players and set to team
  "red" or "blue", reset their skins and change the colors to red and blue.
  (guess which team gets which :p)
* "captain" command announces team captain election. After two votings have been
  accomplished, server enters team picker mode where non-captain players receive
  a number which is represented as their frags if you issue +showscores.
  Captains pick alternately by typing the appropriate number or impulse of
  the player they want in their team until all players are chosen. The last free
  player is automatically set to the other team since there's no other choice
  really. Players entering the server during team picking are numbered and
  marked free unless they have the team of one of the captains, in which case
  they get accepted for that team. Players picked get their master's team and
  color and cannot be picked once again in the same procedure. This command
  supports up to 16 players only; extra players will be unselectable.

Hints:

* Nailhack executable and source is included in the package. You can enhance
  your qwsv executable using this little proggy. Recommended.
* I suggest KT SpawnSafety spawnmodel to avoid telefrags and avoid spawning on
  the same spot twice in a row. (personal advice only)

* removed playerlist from the "status" command.
* admin status is now preserved after mapchange

KOMBAT TEAMS v1.7 updates
-------------------------
* the admin code is now 6 digits instead of 5
* added 1 admin function
               - master (toggle lock on all commands usually allowed to players.

  messages when entering or getting kicked.. should be invisible to the legal players
  now..

* 1 new server value:
               - k_membercount (minimum number of players required in each team
                                for countdown to commence.. 0 = whatever :)
                                an admin forcestart overrides this however)
* added info in countdown message:
               - teamplay mode (doesn't print teamplay if 0)
               - deathmatch mode
               - timelimit (doesn't print timelimit if 0)
               - fraglimit (doesn't print fraglimit if 0)
               - "with powerups" or "no powerups"
* added player-message for firing during pregame when k_prewar is off (not allowed to fire)

  parsing too (not only in the commandlist :))

  (in case you want to take a screenshot of it :))

  but only for servers using k_admins 1
* forcestart now (instead of kicking the players not ready and starting the match in an
  instant) starts a 10 second countdown where players have a chance to ready themselves.
  should they fail to do so, it's bye bye to them whilst the rest of the players get to
  enjoy the (k_count) countdown :)
* admins are now marked in "status"-list with a preceding "*"
* fixed the k_exclusive flag
* !!!!DISPLAYFIX: fixed the missing first second in countdown
* oh, and the 2.10 server was released today. don't worry though as the QuakeC severcode

                              any more players than that during the game.
                              NOTE: players can still disconnect and reconnect)

               - k_lockmap  (if set to 1 the players won't be able to change map)
               - k_sready  (players not ready glows during warmup)
