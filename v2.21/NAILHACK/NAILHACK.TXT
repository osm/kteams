QuakeWorld server nail hack
- allows Qizmo to compress nail data 3 times tighter
- in most cases uses less bandwidth even without Qizmo
- nails fly around smoother and point to the right direction
- sng and ng nails look different, like in regular Quake

For maximum effect set sv_mintic to 0.013 in qwsv console.
(sv_mintic controls how often qwsv updates non-player entities
(rockets, nails, everything else that moves). The default is 0.03,
which amounts to 33fps (1/0.03s). 0.013 (72fps) will get you updated
entities for every qwcl frame -> as smooth as regular Quake. Note
that upping the server fps also ups the cpu load.)

Usage: nailhack qwsvfilename

Should work on any qwsv executable.
Rerun to restore original.
