Commands and settings for people using previous versions of the mod.
--------------------------------------------------------------------

The most important things changing are all the bugfixes implimented as well as the
reduction in CPU usage (on average 50% less cpu) which means nearly twice as many
servers at once :)  See below for list of the bugs fixed in this version.


Bug Fixes
===================
* jump bug where you try to jump a second time and you dont jump but hear the sound. Basically
	bunny hopping is made easier and you now no longer have to toggle cl_maxfps and rate.
	Jimbob will be happy . . .
* Telefrag bug.  You enter teleport after someone and person following gets telefragged.  
	Changed the time from 0.2 to 0.1 so it behaves like normal QuakeWorld.
* no team "" fix 
* if you sit in lava and start duel you get damaged. Thanks to strider 
* fixed the ability to use the timedemo bug. After 3 detections you are kicked on 4th.
* fixed the null bug caused by stuffing too much at once and Qizmo getting narked.
* fixed the bug where player animations became narked.
* fixed problem on level change where you would Z_Alloc caused by stuffing the same aliases again.  
	Caused by people not using large -zone.
* packetlossplayer-startofmatch-allspotsfull-recieveammo fix
* idlebot/forcematchstart now removes player properly.  No more full RL packs from ghost players 
	kicked by either idlebot or an admin forcing start.


New Player Commands
===================
/efficiency  : Shows players efficiences
/stats       : Shows players statistics so far.
/list        : Show all the players that are not ready.  Only once every 10 seconds
/overtime    : Switch from overtime on to overtime off
/overtimeup  : Change the overtime to extend.  Goes from 1 upto 10 then back to 1.


setinfo k_flags 2 : Auto Screenshots scoreboard at end of game.



New Admin Commands
==================
/powerups  : now has a 3rd setting to vary timer spawns.
/forcekick : used for kicking and is very easy to use.
/qpoint    : used to disable pointing on servers.



New server side settings
========================
localinfo k_allowkick 0 or 1 : 0 is allowed and 1 disallowed
localinfo k_maxrate xxxxx    : xxxxx is the maximum rate e.g 10000
localinfo k_minrate xxxxx    : xxxxx is the minimum rate e.g 1500
localinfo k_overtime 0 or 1  : 0 no overtime, 1 overtime added on at end game if draw
localinfo k_exttime 1 to 10  : Time to extend if overtime is set.



-- Possible suggestions by various people for next versions
* overtime sudden death
* /forceready admin command
* voteadmin with k_allowvoteadmin 0/1 being checked.  This is _very_ debateable.
* captains can choose teams by using code similiar to kick code that goes through players and asks if you want on team
* auto-team chooser for biggame pickups
* k_minping & k_maxping supported in server.cfg
* average ping report and packetloss report at endgame. k_printpingreport 1
