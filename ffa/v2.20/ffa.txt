Kombat Teams 2.20 FFA version notes
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Changes to old qw mod:

* all the bugfixes of Kombat Teams (bunnyhop, lava & falling, telefrag, pack...)
* KT SpawnSafety spawnmodel to avoid server crashes caused by telefrags
* rapid-ized teleporter sound (fixed the delay)
* check for timedemo & uptime bugs (uptime bug fix code by Zibbo)
* some improvements to bad&slow code
* players cannot fire during intermission - no ammo wasted
* "scores" command shows remaining time & frags
* new deathmessages added (optional - localinfo k_deathmsg 1 to turn them on)
* player statistics printout & more stuff at the end of every round
* "vote" command for mapchange; by majority vote, map is changed to next one
* fun message commands. Explained:
        You can set 2 strings via setinfo: premsg and postmsg.
        Example: setinfo premsg "Hello "
                 setinfo postmsg "!"
        Then issuing the commands killer, victim or newcomer will put the name
        of a player between these 2 strings and say it.
* auto screenshot of scoreboard if k_flags set to 2 via setinfo
* forced teamplay setting 0; this is an FFA mod, use KTeam for other matches :)
* simple bot check for llama ffa'ers
* oooo...

Have fun :)

Technote: while the uptime bug check is pretty accurate imo, it is still
possible that players might get undue warnings. However, it is very unlikely
and the problem is caused by extreme lag (50-90% packetloss), thus the server
is unplayable over that connection.
