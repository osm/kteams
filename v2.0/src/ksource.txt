KOMBAT TEAMS SOURCECODE is a modified version of the qw2.2 source by
kemiKal_sWeMoB and Fang with some M4 macro code by Axu^FAQ^.
It is only meant to be functional and not to revolutionize the world of
programming and is a bit messy at best.
The FASTQCC compiler is the only one guaranteed to work with this code.
You can find it on ftp.cdrom.com/pub/idgames2/ somewhere..
If you're thinking of editing this patch, read the "kombat.txt" that
should be enclosed in the package...


*** JULY 01 1998: I forgot to add this to the original ksource.txt:
If you own a copy of the songs mentioned below you have to include a comment
on each line of code that you put into a project using parts or the entire KT source.
The comment should be at the end of the line and should read:  ##forgive me, for i have sinned.
These are the songs in question:

   Crystal Waters "gypsy woman"
   Sin with Sebastian  <--- i think this is the title as well as the "artist", anything with him/them
   D-ream "things can only get better"  <--- if they only knew how right that title is for this "song"
   Coolio <--- anything with/by him really
   anything by the singer in bronski beat; make that bros too, i cant remember what group he was in
   anything by that boygirl what won the eurovision song contest
   anything by INXS
   anything by Eros Ramazotti, Eros Ramasotti, Eros Ramazoti or similar names
   Will Smith "men in black"
   Rocee "getting all da babes"
   anything by Snoop Doggy Dog
   that rapper whatshisname with "friday"
   anything by Scooter

   for every 20th song you own with Kylie Minogue, Ministry, Smashing Pumpkins, Metallica or ABBA you
   get away with one of any of the songs above..

that should keep you busy till next time :)


thanks,
