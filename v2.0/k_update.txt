               1. there may be more teams than 2 (so what is the OTHER team?)
               2. it's a suicide message, yielding the player -1 and not a +1 on the other team

  (the standard qw respawns remain unchanged)

* Fixed so that players enter the game in solid form when game is not in progress
  (to avoid telefrag avalanche when changing map)
* Fixed so that no backpacks are dropped if game is not in progress
* Exclusive mode allowed one player less than it was set to, meaning that if one
  player got disconnected he couldnt rejoin, this is fixed..


KOMBAT TEAMS v1.6 updates
-------------------------
* illegal players doesn't make sounds, aren't visible, aren't solid and doesn't emit
  messages when entering or getting kicked.. should be invisible to the legal players
  now..
* telefragging before match now kills players (though no frags are awarded) so the
  players don't get stuck on each other.
* changed no spawn-target time to 60 ticks (see technical note)
* 1 new server value:
               - k_membercount (minimum number of players required in each team
                                for countdown to commence.. 0 = whatever :)
                                an admin forcestart overrides this however)

-------------------------

  parsing too (not only in the commandlist :))
* "report" output changed to mono-colored (like standard say_team from the FAQ-proxy)
* description of the "report" output now removed from pre-game report. just outputs
  your stats as it would during game
* added the printout of frags for each player alongside his/hers rank at matchend
  (in case you want to take a screenshot of it :))
* added the short description of the "admin" command in "commands" (both player and spec)
  but only for servers using k_admins 1
* forcestart now (instead of kicking the players not ready and starting the match in an
  instant) starts a 10 second countdown where players have a chance to ready themselves.
  should they fail to do so, it's bye bye to them whilst the rest of the players get to
  enjoy the (k_count) countdown :)
* admins are now marked in "status"-list with a preceding "*"
* fixed the k_exclusive flag
* !!!!DISPLAYFIX: fixed the missing first second in countdown
* oh, and the 2.10 server was released today. don't worry though as the QuakeC severcode
  is identical to the 2.01 one, meaning that KTx.x works just fine with it :)

                              NOTE: players can still disconnect and reconnect)
* new map: dapak9
