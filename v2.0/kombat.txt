KOMBAT TEAMS v2.0 BETA
----------------------

Kombat Teams is a QUAKEWORLD ONLY patch by kemiKal_sWeMoB and Fang and means
to simplify all forms of deathmatch games (1-1, 2-2, 4-4, 3-3-3, 31-1 etc.).

It's a public release and provided with absolutely no warranties.
The authors take no responsibility for the behaviour and functionality of it.

INSTALLATION
------------

Create a directory called "kteam" in your quakedirectory and copy all files supplied
with the patch into it. Edit the "server.cfg" file to your liking and start the server
by typing "qwsv +gamedir kteam". Please refer to the quakeworld server documentation
if you want your server to show up on any of the masterservers available.
For best server performance, run your server on a machine using unix (or any of its clones)
or a PC running WINDOWS NT. Please make sure that you use the QuakeWorld 2.2 server to
run the patch.

     Shows you the versionnumber of the patch and a small note.

* "ready":
     Tell the server that you're ready for some action.

* "break":
     PREGAME:   tells the server that you're not ready after all.
     COUNTDOWN: stops the countdown (maybe to change some settings).
     MATCH:     toggle your vote for match-break (if you've got a majority voting with

* "tp":
     Steps through teamplay-modes 0-3.

* "powerups":
     Toggles the availability of powerups during game (quad/666/ring/env.suit).
     Pre game, quad and 666 will glow if powerups are enabled and not if not :)

* "discharge":
     Toggles if players should be allowed to "discharge" in water.
     If disabled, players will only loose all their cells on discharge but not
     actually harm anyone.

* "spawn":
     Toggles between
      0. qw respawns (avoid spawnfrags)

     Berzerk mode is meant to release agression built up after a cautious game.
     When only "k_btime" seconds remains of the game, all players gets QUAD/OCTA powered
     for the remainder of the match and the whole level starts strobing.
     The first 2 seconds, everyone enjoys a bit of satan's power.
     (The 2 seconds of 666 was put in to prevent disastrous berzerk rocketjumps)

* "k_soundX":
     Where X is a value between 1 and 6.
     Plays a soundfile on all your teammates computers (if they've got k_sound
     set to 1). If you want your client to play sounds that your teammates triggers,
     type (in the console):
            setinfo k_sound 1
     Your teammates must have the files "ktsound1.wav" - "ktsound6.wav" in their
     "id1/sound" directory or they won't hear anything regardless of the k_sound
     flag.
     Remember: If you trigger ktsound1.wav, it will play the ktsound1.wav that
               resides on your teammates disk/s, not the one on yours.
     *** The default samples are:
         ktsound1.wav "Home"
         ktsound2.wav "Cellar"
         ktsound3.wav "Tower"
         ktsound4.wav "Help/Assist"
         ktsound5.wav "Warning"
         ktsound6.wav "Report"
 
     The standard soundbanks can be found at http://www.kemikal.com.
     To be able to use your samples on any server running KT1.96 or higher -
     put the samples in your "ID1/sound" directory (if "sound" doesn't exist,
     create it yourself).
     Alternatively you can create subdirectories inside ID1/sound called
     "male", "female" etc. and put the desired soundbanks into these - then
     during game you can tell Kombat Teams that you want a female voice by
     typing (in the console):
            setinfo k_sdir "female"

* ("admin"):
     If admins are allowed on the server, this is how you become one.
     A six digit code will then be asked of you.
     Each digit is entered by an impulse command between 1 and 9.


SPECTATOR COMMANDS EXPLAINED

     Prints playerlist.

* "join":
     Reconnects to server as a player (spectator 0 and reconnect).

* ("admin"):
     If admins are allowed on the server, this is how you become one.
     A six digit code will then be asked of you.

     they're still not ready.
     Readied admins may type break to interrupt the countdown.
     Countdown then commences as usual.

* "forcebreak":
     Forces match to end.
     Results will be logged as usual but "%forcebreak%<adminname>" will tell
     statistics-programs that the match was ended unnaturally and by whom.

* "lockmap":
     Toggles maplock.
     If maplock is enabled, only admins may change map.

* "prewar":
     Toggles the "k_prewar" flag.
     When k_prewar = 1:  players can fire prior to match
                         (actually they can fire during too :))
     When k_prewar = 0:  players can't fire prior to match
                         (this is the discipline setting)

KOMBAT TEAMS technical notes
----------------------------

*** KOMBAT TEAMS IN DUEL MODE :

If k_duel is set to 1, the server will not allow teamplay changes.
Meaning, if you're running a 1-1 server - set k_duel to 1 and teamplay to 0.


*** THE OPTIONAL MODIFIED DEATHMATCH 2 MODE :

Setting the flag "k_dm2mod" in the server.cfg to 1 removes all armor on the map at
matchstart if deathmatch mode 2 is chosen. The normal dmm2 is available by setting
the same serverflag to "0".


*** WHAT'S THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE RESPAWN-TYPES? :

Kombat Teams respawns differs from the normal QW respawns (also available in the
patch) in that they spawn players on a spawnpoint even though someone else is occupying
it. There's exceptions to this rule however, a player that has just spawned is
considered a no spawn-target for 60 gameticks and a player can never spawn on the same
spot twice in a row (unless the map contains less than 2 spawnpoints or all spawnpoints
are full).
For the first 3 seconds of a match, Kombat Teams respawns will attempt to avoid spawnfrags
entirely (note that this is only for the spawntype "Kombat Teams respawns").
To have yourself spawned at what you consider to be a bad spawn before the match starts
as not to get there won't work, the patch doesn't take pregame spawns into account.
This type of respawns is by default enabled in KT since the patch's main function is to
handle teamgames and we don't want any camping on important spots (like RA on dm4 for
example).
Since the release of version 1.93, a hybrid between the two types exists. The hybrid avoids
spawning on other players if possible (ie atleast one spot is empty) and tries avoiding
spawning you on the spot twice in a row.


*** WHAT'S UP WITH THE LEVEL EXITS? :

KT removes all "level-exits" at the start of each match. You will be able to walk through
those teleporters without anything happening. Pre-game, you can still change level by
walking through them (if the server's "samelevel" is set accordingly).


*** WHAT "report" REALLY REPORTS:

Best illustrated by example output, here's a couple:

(player): a:0  h:100  sg:25       (no armor, 100 health and a shotgun with 25 shells)
(player): ga:30  h:30  rl:5       (30 worth of green armor, 30 health and rocket launcher
                                  with 5 rockets)
(player): ra:200  h:250  rl:100  [-quad-]
                                  (200 units of red armor, 250 health, a rocket launcher
                                  with 100 rockets and the player is quadpowered)

ARMOR TYPES: green (GA) yellow (YA) and red (RA)
WEAPONS: (this is the importancy order from lowest to highest)
         axe (AXE) shotgun (SG) nailgun (NG) super shotgun (SSG) super nailgun (SNG)
         grenade launcher (GL) lightning gun (LG) rocker launcher (RL)


*** WHAT'S WITH ALL THOSE "his glasses" AND "his death" TEXTS? :

Quake (and QW) uses male orientated messages that may or may not annoy you depending
on your gender. Since the legend tells that there are a few girls and women out there
gibbing with the rest of us, KT's got a function that displays genderbased messages
accordingly. Your gender is determined as MALE by default but can be set to
female by typing (in the console):
                      setinfo gender f
(alternatively, you can put that line in your autoexec.cfg).
Anything other than an "f" is considered a MALE..


*** ABOUT TEAM-TELEFRAGS:

If you get telefragged by one of your teammates, s/he doesn't get any frags for it
but you get a death registred (not a -1 on frags but a +1 on deaths).


*** LOCKTYPES:

OFF  = no locking.
ALL  = lockout all players trying to enter if game is in progress.
TEAM = lockout all players trying to enter during match if their team is not set to
       one of the teams playing.

Serversettings that functions as locks of a sort, are:
k_lockmin (minimum number of teams in game)
k_lockmax (maximum number of teams in game)
k_membercount (minimum number of players in each team)
k_exclusive (if set, maxplayers is locked on matchstart)


*** DEFAULTS:

On /reset the following happens:

k_spectalk = 1
deathmatch = 1
if k_duel = 0 then teamplay = 3
if k_duel = 1 then teamplay = 0
fraglimit = 0
timelimit = k_timetop
k_spw = 2   (kombat teams respawns)
k_pow = 1   (powerups on)
k_dis = 1   (discharges allowed)
k_bzk = 0   (berzerk mode disabled)
k_666 = 0   (spawn666 off)
k_frp = 1   (fairpacks enabled)
dq = 0      (drop quad off)
dr = 0      (drop ring off)
dp = 1      (drop backpacks on)
lock = TEAM (see technical notes on locktypes) 

*** ALIEN MAPS:

Since KT support maps that some people might not have on their hd it also allows the serveradmin
to set a defaultmap to which it will change to when the last player on the server logs out.
Alternatively ofcourse, the admin (you) can allow map downloading.
The localinfo value to set defaultmap is called "k_defmap". If "k_defmap" is not set - KT won't
try to change to the default map.
